# dataStructures_Algorithms
##  1.Introduction 
### 1.1 Variables
In computer science programming we need something for holding data and 
*variables* is the way to do that. 
### 1.2 Data Types
System-defined data types: primitive data types
User-defined data.
### 1.3 Data Structure
Data structures:
_ Linear data structures:
_ Non-linear data structures. Tree and graphs

### 1.4 Abstract Data Types
Based on the discussion above, once we have data in variables, we need some 
mechanism for manipulating that data to solve problems.
ADTs: Declaration of data
      Declaration of operations.
Commonly use ADTs include:Linked Lists,Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues, Binary Trees,
Dictionaries, Disjoint Sets(Union and Find), Hash Tables, Graphs, and many others.

### 1.5 What is an Algorithm?
AN Algorithm is the step-by-step unambiguous to solve a given problem.

### 1.6 Why the Analysis of Algorithms.
To go from city "A" to city "B", there can be many ways of accomplishing this: by flight, by bus,..
and also by bicycle. Depending on the availability and convenience, we choose the one that suits.
Similarly, in computer science, multiple algorithms are available for solving the same problem.
Algorithm analysis helps us to determine which algorithm is most efficient in terms of time and space consumed

### 1.7 Goal of the Analysis of Algorithms
The goal of the analysis of algorithms is to compare algorithms (or solutions) mainly terms of running time but also in terms 
of other factors.

### 1.8 What is Running Time Analysis
It is process of determining how processing time increases as the size of the problem increases.
Common types of inputs:
_ Size of an array
_ Polynomial degree
_ NUmber of elements in a matrix
_ Number of bits in the binary representation of the input
_ Vertices and edges in a graph

### 1.9 How to Compare Algorithms 
Let us define a few objective measures:
_ Execution times
_ Number of statement executed
_ Ideal solution

### 1.10 What is Rate of Growth?
That rate at which the running time increases as a function of input is calle *Rate of Growth*

### 1.11  Commonly used Rates of Growth
Time complexity             Name
1                           Constant
log(n)                      Logarithmic
n                           Linear
nlog(n)                     Linear logarithmic
n^2                         Quadratic
n^3                         Cubic
2^n                         Exponential

Decreasing Rate of Growth:
2^(2^n) - n! - 4^n - 2^n - n^2 -nlog(n) - log(n!) - n - 2^(log(n)) - log(n)^2 -
Can bac hai log(n) - log (log(n)) -1

### 1.12 Types of Analysis
To analyze the given algorithm, we need to know with which inputs the algorithm takes less time (preforming well)
and with which inputs the algorithm takes a long time.
Worst case:
_ Defines the input for which the algorithm takes a long time(the slowest time to complete).
_ Input is the one for which the algorithms run the slowest.
Best case:
_ Defines the input for which the algorithm takes the least time(the fastest time to complete).
_ Input is the one for which the algorithm run the fastest.
Average case:
_ Provides a prediction about the running time of algorithm.
_ Assumes that the input is random
_ Run the algorithm many times

### 1.13 Asymptotic Notation
Having the expressions for the best, average and worst case, for all there case we need to identify
the upper and lower bounds.

### 1.14 Big-O Notation
This notation gives the tight upper bound of the given function.
f(n) = O(g(n)).
That means, at larger values of n, the upper bound of f(n) is g(n).

Big-O Visualization
No Uniqueness? there is no unique set of values for n0 and c is proving the asymptotic bounds.

### 1.15 Omega- Notation
Similar to the O discussion, this notation gives the tighter lower bound of the given algorithm, and we represent is
f(n) = Î©(g(n))
## Question pre
1. What is the rate of growth?
   That rate at which the running time increases as a function of input is calle *Rate of Growth*

2. Type of analysis?
   It has three type of analysis: 
   _ Worst case.
   _ Best case.
   _ Average case.
   
3. What is the big O notation?
   Big-O notation is  gives the tight upper bound of the give function.
4. Asymptotic analysis
_ Total time of a loop?
_ Total time of nested loop?
   Total time for consecutive statements?
   Total time for if then else statement?
5. Identify O(?)of the F(n) = 5n4 +3n2 + 2n2+4n +1
6. ------------------- F(n) = 5n2 +3nlog(n)+ 2n +5
7. ------------------- F(n) = 3log(n) +2.

   ````java
   int sum = 0
   for(int n = N;n>0;n/=2)
        for(int i=0; i<n;i++)
            sum++;
